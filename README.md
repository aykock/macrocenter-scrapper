Guys, please save your data in CSV format so that we all use a common file type. In the future, you’ll be working with each other’s datasets, so it’s important that we have a single standardized format.

Also, move your codes and data from the previous repository to this one. I will delete the old repository over the weekend.

And please don’t forget to pull the project regularly so you can see the latest code and data updated by your teammates and me.
